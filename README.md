# A Day to Drive Hard!
COMP602 Software Development Practice Project for Team TBD

The main aim of this game is to drive as far as you possibly can without dying. Throughout the game you will be driving along randomly generated terrain while trying to avoid obstacles which will take away your health. However, you will also have assistance with upgrades that can be purchased to increase your survivability, or powerups that can be collected throughout the game to assist you as you're driving.

The car can be fast at times, flip ALOT, or sometimes screw you over by running into obstacles you didn't see, but this all adds to the excitement of the game and can be fun to mess around and perform epic flips and stunts to gain you more points.

Current Game Features:
- Random Terrain Generation
- Driveable Car via Keyboard AND Touch Controls
- Jumping with the car
- Stunts
- Music and sound effects
- Randomly Generated Obstacles & powerups
- Car Upgrades (Speed, Health)
- Plus there is a little easter egg in the game, if you can find it!
